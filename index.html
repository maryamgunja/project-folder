			<h1>The dark, violent underworld of the baby chimp market</h1>
			<h3>By Lauren Tousignant</h3>

			<p>Black market traders massacre <strong>chimpanzees</strong> in order to steal their babies and sell them for $12,500 as pets or zoo animals, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-5e8c4bac-c236-4cd9-bacc-db96d733f6cf">a heartbreaking BBC investigation has uncovered.</a></p>

			<p>A group of undercover BBC reporters posed as <em>buyers</em> to help bust a notorious international network of wildlife traffickers known as the “blue room” in West Africa.</p>

			<p>The traffickers kill about 10 adult chimpanzees for every infant, making it easier to capture the baby without resistance. The adults’ bodies are then sold for bushmeat.<a href="http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/kids/photos/animals/Mammals/H-P/koala-closeup-tree.jpg.adapt.945.1.jpg"><img src="next"></a>
